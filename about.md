### So, what's going on here?
A Jekyll static site starter kit pre-styled with Bootstrap 3.3.6 &mdash; no offence meant to the guys at Jekyll, but we got rid of most of their style.

Bootstrapped Jekyll is designed to be three different things:

1. A place for me to start when building a website for a new project (designed to eliminate a lot of repetitive tasks I find myself doing)
2. A starter kit for anyone wanting to use Jekyll with Bootstrap
3. A psuedo tutorial for beginner web developers interested in Jekyll
